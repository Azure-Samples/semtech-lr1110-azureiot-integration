# Visualizing Geolocation data using Power BI and Azure Maps

The purpose of this document is to provide an example of how to create a Power BI report to visualize geolocation data using Azure Maps.

## Pre-requisites

Prior to creating a Power BI report for visualizing your geolocation data, you need to make sure that you have been able to gather at least a few data points in your Azure SQL database after deploying our Azure Sample solution for onboarding Semtech’s LoRa Edge tracker.
The instructions below assume that you have already deployed this solution and that you have lat/long coordinates already stored in the database.

## Instructions

- Start Power BI Desktop application. If you don’t have it, please download it from [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop?WT.mc_id=Blog_Desktop_Update).

- Go to “File > Options and settings > Options”, select “Preview Features” and make sure that “Azure map visual” is selected ![](../images/).
